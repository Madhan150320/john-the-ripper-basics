# üîê John the Ripper ‚Äì Password Cracking Basics

Welcome to my hands-on learning repository focused on **John the Ripper**, a widely used password cracking tool in cybersecurity. This project is part of my ethical hacking practice and cybersecurity training.

## üìå About This Project

John the Ripper (JtR) is a powerful open-source tool used to identify weak passwords through brute force or dictionary attacks. In this repository, I demonstrate basic usage of JtR to understand how password hashes can be cracked for security testing and learning purposes.

## üîß How I Used John the Ripper

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Cracking Linux Shadow File
```bash
unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > full_shadow.txt
john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt full_shadow.txt
````

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Cracking ZIP File Password

```bash
zip2john secret.zip > zip_hash.txt
john --wordlist=wordlists/custom_wordlist.txt zip_hash.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Show Cracked Passwords

```bash
john --show zip_hash.txt
```

## üìö What I Learned

* Fundamentals of password hashing and cracking
* Using common wordlists for dictionary attacks
* Basic usage of `zip2john` and `unshadow` tools
* Importance of strong passwords in real-world systems
